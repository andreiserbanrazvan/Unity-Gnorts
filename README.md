# This is a Real Time Strategy game in Unity
Although the Code is public for people to see, if you want to use it in any commercial way you need to contact me.
I do NOT allow you or anyone to use my code and just sell it without my permission.

If you want to help on this game, or create your own with it, just contact me and/or fork it.
