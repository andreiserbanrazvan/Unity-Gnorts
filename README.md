# This is a Real Time Strategy game in Unity
Although the Code is public for people to see, if you want to use it in any commercial way you need to contact me.
I do NOT allow you or anyone to use my code and just sell it. (Mostly called 'asset flips')

If you want to help on this game, or create your own with it, just contact me and/or fork it. 
All people who want to help are welcome to do so! 
This project is mostly a learning project, but if it would ever hit the market you would for sure be credited for the things you've done and such!

3) Open Unity and do 'File-Open project' Select the 'Unity-Gnorts' folder and open the project (This will take a long time if it's the first time)
